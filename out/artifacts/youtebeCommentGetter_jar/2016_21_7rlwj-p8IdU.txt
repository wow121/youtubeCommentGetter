wars. Why would these BRAIN DEAD COUNTRIES want to kill their cash cow. 
'The military Industrial Complex' which is the only existing profitable 
business/industry driving their respective economies. By the way the war in 
Syria is still alive & well & will be so till the people rise up against 
their Governments & say STOP IT 'Enough is Enough'.

2016-06-02T06:30:24.000Z  arat360 --> Surud Patel : The thing is that while Russia certainly has a stronger standing military, 
there is no doubt that the US has the largest capability to put troops 
anywhere in the world. I do not doubt that if the US and Russia were 
connected by land that Russia would come out on top, but the ocean is a 
large place, and that is where the war would truly be fought.

Let me write some other numbers.
USSR asked for large bunker busting bombs. And got them! Total amount - 60 
bombs.
In total, Allies supplied about 19.000 tanks to the USSR. Approximate 
amount of tanks participated ONLY in Battle of Kursk - 8.000 (both sides). 
To imagine the scale.
The major part of lend-lease help started to arrive in 1943. After Battle 
of Stalingrad, and several other.
USSR asked for much needed B-29 'Superfortress' bombers. Received - none.
Total amount of fearsome 'Tiger' tanks in Africa - 8. Eastern Front - ~800. 
Allied/German troops ratio in Africa - approximately 10 to 1.
10% of total US aid went to USSR. 30% went to Great Britain. To compare, 
British army of that time - 2 million men, Soviet - ~30 million men.
Total amount of US equipment in Soviet army by the end of the war - 4%.
Lend-lease bill - 12 billion dollars. Today - ~170 billion (partially paid 
with gold).

2016-08-14T17:55:09.000Z  Иван Сусанин --> all4dh8rz : Not alone, but largest Japan army and most of Nazi and their allies forces 
were defeated by USSR.
Russians very appreciated help from allies. In time of war in Europe, help 
came mostly from US and GB - according to some of sources, up to 3% of all 
necessary supplies came from these states.

2016-08-12T19:03:13.000Z  Русское море --> all4dh8rz : +Alien Moto You forgot to specify that Russia paid America GOLD for "help". 
You modestly about how the United States helped Germany. America is true to 
herself. She has always been enriched by military conflicts.

2016-08-12T17:47:21.000Z  cliff njikang --> all4dh8rz : ' however&#160;they did not win the war alone. Not one bit!' The history 
books have it different. Your fraud will not get you very far. If the 
Russians had not decimated Hitler's Forces when he invaded Russia, All woud 
have been different and you Americans would have had to face the full brunt 
of Hitlers's Army , which was technologically advanced by several 
generations ahead of you! And funny enough, you Americans are walking right 
in his footsteps by invading and destroying smaller defenceless countries 
like Libya, Iraq, Syriua and Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever!

2016-07-18T22:07:42.000Z  Executive 1 --> all4dh8rz : +Alien Moto i agree with you, without that 7% equipment the soviets 
probably would of lost Stalingrad, however most people try to make it look 
like the americans and british fully armed the soviet army

1. Fucking russians? Russians good people.
2. Why you needed to be protected from Russians? I remind that it is Hitler 
(Western civilization) and almost all Europe attacked Russians in 1941, and 
in 1945 you (Western civilization) launched Cold war against Russians and 
this war against Russians continues still in spite of the fact that 
Russians liquidated the Warsaw pact, left Afghanistan, Eastern Europe, 
Vietnam, Cuba, liquidated the USSR, refused a communism. But you still 
didn't refuse Cold war against Russia. The USA promised Gorbachev that 
Eastern Europe won't become part of NATO, you deceived and it is an act of 
aggression against Russia. Moreover, even the former republics of the USSR, 
the Baltic countries, became part of NATO, it is an act of aggression 
against Russia. Today you place military bases there, it is an act of 
aggression against Russia. The USA organizes idiotic propaganda in Sweden 
about the Russian submarines to force this country to enter NATO, you try 
to make with Finland the same shit and it is an act of aggression against 
Russia. The USA organized revolutions in Georgia and in Ukraine, the 
American puppets provoke Russia and it is an act of aggression again. 
AGGRESSION of the West against Russians. So who is fucking and from whom it 
is necessary to be protected?

+Gog Mclaine: "defended democracy against communism"
You protected not democracy, you protected capitalism, probably it is 
pleasant to you when 1% of people super rich, and remaining 99% on the 
verge of poverty. Propaganda of capitalists still works well, such fools as 
you have the outstanding credits in 10 banks and try to take the credit in 
the eleventh, BUT HATE COMMUNISM. And real democracy, a possibility of 
simple people to influence in the USSR was much more than in such 
totalitarian country as the USA where banksters can kill the president and 
members of his family because of the fact that they didn't want to submit 
to those people about whom you know nothing. These people rule America, but 
not your presidents. John Kennedy didn't even try to be completely 
independent, but it was killed. This your false democracy, Judeo-Masons 
kill your presidents as dogs, and you tell fairy tales about democracy. LOL!

May be you are still in LIQUID FORM in some distance place during the early

begging the Russian Scientists n pilots as well as the Chinese scientists n 
pilots to defect with their latest equipment/technologies to their puppet 
countries promising them big reward in GOLD, CASH n other benefits.
After the breakup of USSR, the United Snakes of Americunts go the the 
former Warsaw countries to grab the "latest" USSR equipment/technologies to 
build new weapons. 
After year 2000, what new weapons, beside *F-35* have United Snakes of 
Americunts develop?

чрезвычайно слабое и неэффективное? Вы шутите? У авианосной ударной группы 
радиус действия несколько тысяч километров, и, предполагая, что Вы мне 
возразите - что можно одну ракету отправить и всё это накрыть медным тазом, 
да, баллистическая ракета долетит, но это в отличие от АУГ предельно 
негибкое оружие. Его пуск нельзя отменить и вернуть ракету на базу. А АУГ 
всегда можно развернуть, переукомплектовать, АУГ не обязана фигачить 
атомными бомбами, она может и обычными, её всегда можно перенацелить, 
вернуть, и вообще всё что угодно. И вы говорите, что это неэффективный 
инструмент современной войны? А наш крейсер Москва - видимо, эффективный. 
Да он до зоны ПВО АУГ в случае чего даже не доплывёт. Если только не 
бросить на сопровождение атаки полка два Ту-22М3 с соответствующим 
истребительным прикрытием.

сегодня. Америкосы тоже думали много чего, и щас думают, как так 
получилось, что у России все летает, и попадает. Авианосцы уничтожат в 
первую очередь, хоть балистами, хоть специально придумаными ракетами для 
них. Ну и вспоминайте уже быстрее про такие штуки как Хибины и много чего 
еще.

авианосцы это братские могилы? Ух ты. А я-то думал, что АУГ - это самые 
современные и мощные ударные системы вооружения в мире, с радиусом обороны 
в тысячи километров. В шестидесятых годах на уничтожение одной АУГ клалось 
по советстким расчётам два авиаполка, без особых шансов вернуться, и с 
применением спецБЧ. Братские могилы, угу.
