there is no doubt that the US has the largest capability to put troops 
anywhere in the world. I do not doubt that if the US and Russia were 
connected by land that Russia would come out on top, but the ocean is a

Let me write some other numbers.
USSR asked for large bunker busting bombs. And got them! Total amount - 60 
bombs.
In total, Allies supplied about 19.000 tanks to the USSR. Approximate 
amount of tanks participated ONLY in Battle of Kursk - 8.000 (both sides). 
To imagine the scale.
The major part of lend-lease help started to arrive in 1943. After Battle 
of Stalingrad, and several other.
USSR asked for much needed B-29 'Superfortress' bombers. Received - none.
Total amount of fearsome 'Tiger' tanks in Africa - 8. Eastern Front - ~800. 
Allied/German troops ratio in Africa - approximately 10 to 1.
10% of total US aid went to USSR. 30% went to Great Britain. To compare, 
British army of that time - 2 million men, Soviet - ~30 million men.
Total amount of US equipment in Soviet army by the end of the war - 4%.
Lend-lease bill - 12 billion dollars. Today - ~170 billion (partially paid 
with gold).

2016-08-14T17:55:09.000Z  –ò–≤–∞–Ω –°—É—Å–∞–Ω–∏–Ω --> all4dh8rz : Not alone, but largest Japan army and most of Nazi and their allies forces

Russians very appreciated help from allies. In time of war in Europe, help 
came mostly from US and GB - according to some of sources, up to 3% of all 
necessary supplies came from these states.

2016-08-12T17:47:21.000Z  cliff njikang --> all4dh8rz : ' however&#160;they did not win the war alone. Not one bit!' The history 
books have it different. Your fraud will not get you very far. If the 
Russians had not decimated Hitler's Forces when he invaded Russia, All woud 
have been different and you Americans would have had to face the full brunt 
of Hitlers's Army , which was technologically advanced by several 
generations ahead of you! And funny enough, you Americans are walking right 
in his footsteps by invading and destroying smaller defenceless countries 
like Libya, Iraq, Syriua and Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever!

2016-07-18T22:07:42.000Z  Executive 1 --> all4dh8rz : +Alien Moto i agree with you, without that 7% equipment the soviets

2016-05-15T19:04:12.000Z  Tagashka --> hugoraphaeli : +Gog Mclaine: "saved us from the fucking russians"
1. Fucking russians? Russians good people.
2. Why you needed to be protected from Russians? I remind that it is Hitler 
(Western civilization) and almost all Europe attacked Russians in 1941, and 
in 1945 you (Western civilization) launched Cold war against Russians and 
this war against Russians continues still in spite of the fact that 
Russians liquidated the Warsaw pact, left Afghanistan, Eastern Europe, 
Vietnam, Cuba, liquidated the USSR, refused a communism. But you still 
didn't refuse Cold war against Russia. The USA promised Gorbachev that 
Eastern Europe won't become part of NATO, you deceived and it is an act of 
aggression against Russia. Moreover, even the former republics of the USSR, 
the Baltic countries, became part of NATO, it is an act of aggression 
against Russia. Today you place military bases there, it is an act of 
aggression against Russia. The USA organizes idiotic propaganda in Sweden 
about the Russian submarines to force this country to enter NATO, you try 
to make with Finland the same shit and it is an act of aggression against 
Russia. The USA organized revolutions in Georgia and in Ukraine, the 
American puppets provoke Russia and it is an act of aggression again. 
AGGRESSION of the West against Russians. So who is fucking and from whom it 
is necessary to be protected?

+Gog Mclaine: "defended democracy against communism"
You protected not democracy, you protected capitalism, probably it is 
pleasant to you when 1% of people super rich, and remaining 99% on the 
verge of poverty. Propaganda of capitalists still works well, such fools as 
you have the outstanding credits in 10 banks and try to take the credit in 
the eleventh, BUT HATE COMMUNISM. And real democracy, a possibility of 
simple people to influence in the USSR was much more than in such 
totalitarian country as the USA where banksters can kill the president and 
members of his family because of the fact that they didn't want to submit 
to those people about whom you know nothing. These people rule America, but 
not your presidents. John Kennedy didn't even try to be completely 
independent, but it was killed. This your false democracy, Judeo-Masons 
kill your presidents as dogs, and you tell fairy tales about democracy. LOL!

2016-05-15T16:52:18.000Z  –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –°–º–∏—Ä–Ω–æ–≤ --> –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –°–º–∏—Ä–Ω–æ–≤ : NATO needs, in the end, enough threats in the world. Russian NATO 
indifferent. Enough for one of the thermo nuclear bombs of 200 megatons the 
whole world, even if its to blow up the base. Chernobyl will seem like a 
resort. I served in the missile troops, I know. We should be friends and 
trade. To isolate the 1/7 of the planet, don't You think strange event?

2016-05-16T08:08:50.000Z  Tagashka --> Monster Shrimp : +Gog Mclaine eastern expansion? LOL! The West come to Eastern Europe, the 
Baltic countries, Cuba (Guantanamo), the Balkans, Afghanistan, and this is 
not the complete list, now the USA tries to involve Sweden and Finland in 
NATO. So who is engaged in expansion?

2016-05-17T08:40:17.000Z  TheBigBosnian --> Sandra Kopcok : +Fab and Nab oh thank you very much :D 500 years, blod is not water black 
hair black eyes dark skin(real serbians are not like that) :D I really dont 
get why you go to Russia, really you have more connection with Turkye :D 
But I dont care :D

2016-05-16T23:19:16.000Z  Blue Cap --> Sandra Kopcok : +TheBigBosnian first of all good grammar! congrats :P and I'm pretty sure 
that if 90% of Serbia where Turkish it wouldn't de a Slavic Country.

vlasi do not have nothing with romanians. and you are pathetic izrod.

2016-05-15T16:07:11.000Z  John Doe --> Janmark Pralkin : +Dani Rumold jast google what is t-34 tank) in ww2 we made over 60K (60000) 
of them in a little time

2016-05-15T07:50:17.000Z  Victoria Chok --> R WARRIOR : +R WARRIOR What?????????
May be you are still in LIQUID FORM in some distance place during the early 
1960's. At that time, the United Snakes of Americunts n its allies were 
begging the Russian Scientists n pilots as well as the Chinese scientists n 
pilots to defect with their latest equipment/technologies to their puppet 
countries promising them big reward in GOLD, CASH n other benefits.
After the breakup of USSR, the United Snakes of Americunts go the the 
former Warsaw countries to grab the "latest" USSR equipment/technologies to 
build new weapons. 
After year 2000, what new weapons, beside *F-35* have United Snakes of 
Americunts develop?

The rest is history.

2016-05-20T14:41:40.000Z  Brad Davies --> Brad Davies : +Ilya Smirnov Sure o.k. whatever.

2016-05-20T05:41:45.000Z  Ilya Smirnov --> Brad Davies : +Brad Davies Putin has other dimensions. While Chuck Norris fights on the 
screen, Putin kills terrorism in the Middle East.
