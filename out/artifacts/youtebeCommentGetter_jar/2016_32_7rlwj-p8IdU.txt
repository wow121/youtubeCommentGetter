2016-08-05T21:41:01.000Z  Shinzo's Sins : In modern army they say for pictures like this: target rich enviroment. 
Don't get me wrong those are cool machines, Tanks, jets, warships all cool 
stuff. But it was the edge in 80's not today. Today most important on 
battlefield is information about enemy. I have no idea what satelite cover 
Russia have but i would be probably more impressed with information like 
that than with pictures of previous century's equpiment.﻿

2016-08-01T01:47:09.000Z  AKM5.45 SHOOTER : NATO aggression needs to end. There is no Russian aggression, and I can 
smash anyone in a debate. The people who thinks there is Russian aggression 
are brainwashed and don't know the truth. Russian aggression is a myth. The 
US is the aggressor and NATO members are just their puppets. Any yanks want 
to debate me without using CNN as a source? Haha😂 900+ military bases 
around the world and tranny and gay yanks are claiming they are the victims 
of fake Russian aggression﻿


2016-07-31T17:13:17.000Z  Nick Sofialakis : The Russian machinery will always be easier to maintain with less flimsy 
parts and useless extra bits and pieces.
Russian engineering will remain clean and robust in anyway, from rockets 
guns electronics planes submarines that will last for ever under any 
extreme conditions.﻿

2016-07-31T19:03:11.000Z  Александр Желтоухов --> Pretty sure a century is 10,000 years. Yeah : Throw drugs!

2016-07-31T19:02:26.000Z  Александр Желтоухов --> Pretty sure a century is 10,000 years. Yeah : Russia liberated China. The Americans received from the Japanese and used 
them against the atomic bomb. Against the losing country without nuclear 
weapons. It's a shame for America!

2016-08-01T02:01:50.000Z  AKM5.45 SHOOTER --> Wiktor Krulik : +jim mwai You do realize that the world hates American right? It's because 
the US govt made American people look like savages and warmongering 
murderers. I've traveled the world ever since I was 6, and people do view 
Americans as bad people thanks to the US govt. From 6-14, I traveled with 
my parent and met all sorts of people who criticizes American. My mom is 
Vietnamese and my dad is French-American, but people don't realize that we 
all have American citizenship so they talk shit about Americans. Even when 
I got older from 16-present day, I got to travel the world by myself or 
with friends. We all get criticize for being Americans, so I have to speak 
other languages like Vietnamese or French to avoid problems. I've had 
French, Germans, Thai's, Aussies, Latinos (South American nationals), 
Mexicans, and all sorts of people around the world who views Americans as 
being fat, stupid, brainwashed, and lazy. That's the most common thing I've 
heard so far

2016-08-01T01:52:33.000Z  AKM5.45 SHOOTER --> Wiktor Krulik : +jim mwai True. The US government is the problem. Most of the American 
people are good people who are victims of US govt propaganda. Most 
Americans don't even know that Obama legalized propaganda to be used 
against the population a while back. It's called the NDAA amendment 114. 
The media is lying to the American people and the US govt has gone rogue. 
Americans need to stand up to their govt. instead of being two faced when 
the topic is about Russia, Americans need to support Russia. Russia isn't 
the ones going around starting all sorts of war since ww2 ended. Even the 
conflict in Ukraine, Georgia, and Chechenia was lied about by the US media 
and govt. declassified documents proves this

2016-08-01T01:49:33.000Z  AKM5.45 SHOOTER --> Wiktor Krulik : +Jux Lord You're a fucking idiot. The US has invaded 70+ countries and 
started all the wars since WW2 ended, but you're blaming Russia? Fuck you 
piece of shit brainwashed fucked. The US is the aggressor. Americans are so 
stupid and hypocrites. They constantly bash and hate their govt, but when 
the topic is about Russia or China, they act like two faced hypocrites. 
Russia is not the aggressor. The US and their puppet NATO members are. You 
have to be stupid or brainwashed to not know this

2016-08-01T02:07:03.000Z  AKM5.45 SHOOTER --> Maxx Carter : +Gog Mclaine What the fuck are you talking about, dumbfuck? You should be 
thanking Russia that you aren't speaking German right now. Hitler sent 80% 
of his ground troops to the eastern fronts while a tiny 15-20% of Nazi 
ground troops were in the western fronts. If Hitler didn't invade the 
Soviets, the western fronts would have been demolish by the Nazis. US 
troops had trouble fighting the western fronts when they fought the 
rookies. The Russians fought Hitler's best men and they still got to Berlin 
first. The Russia Federation today does not want to invade anyone or 
restore the Soviet Union. They have repeatedly mentioned that but NATO is 
expanding closer to Russia every year! Russia is defending her interests 
and her people from US/NATO aggression. The US lied to Russia when Russia 
voluntary dissolved the USSR. You're brainwashed as fuck
