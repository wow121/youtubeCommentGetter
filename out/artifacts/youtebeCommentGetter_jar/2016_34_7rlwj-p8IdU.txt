40 “And in the time of [the] end the king of the south will engage with him 
in a pushing, and against him the king of the north will storm with 
chariots and with horsemen and with many ships; and he will certainly enter 
into the lands and flood over and pass through. 41 He will also actually 
enter into the land of the Decoration, and there will be many [lands] that 
will be made to stumble. But these are the ones that will escape out of his 
hand, E′dom and Mo′ab and the main part of the sons of Am′mon. 42 And he 
will keep thrusting out his hand against the lands; and as regards the land 
of Egypt, she will not prove to be an escapee. 43 And he will actually rule 
over the hidden treasures of the gold and the silver and over all the 
desirable things of Egypt. And the Lib′y‧ans and the E‧thi‧o′pi‧ans will be 
at his steps.
44 “But there will be reports that will disturb him, out of the sunrising 
and out of the north, and he will certainly go forth in a great rage in 
order to annihilate and to devote many to destruction. 45 And he will plant 
his palatial tents between [the] grand sea and the holy mountain of 
Decoration; and he will have to come all the way to his end, and there will 
be no helper for him﻿

2016-08-14T11:42:45.000Z  Виталий N --> yahya laouici : Это Российская космический наблюдательный пункт который работает не только 
по планете земля, но и в ближнем и дальнем космосе. Любое передвижение даже 
маленького объекта в воздухе всей нашей планеты не будет не замеченным. Эта 
станция видит абсолютно всё и всех. Я думаю любой враг России будет её 
устранять в первую очередь в случае войны. Это космические глаза страны.

2016-08-14T18:27:52.000Z  Stefan Haken --> shiek rabbani : Are you that fucking stupid to think that saudis or the turks or the 
western countries to invade syria? Nearly every Countrie is dropping bombs 
to Syria and its Wrong! There are some Countries i know which will leave 
the NATO. Ive heard that Turkey is also going to leave. Lets see.

2016-08-14T18:40:44.000Z  Stefan Haken --> Tzimmi The Greek Jr. : There are soooo much Politicians in ISIS which tell them to kill People and 
in which cruelty. Thousands of People die Weekly in the middle East. 
Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists all of them are killing Muslims. Its so naturel 
that they defend themselves. If you dont want refugees then your Country 
should tell the EU to stop selling Weapons. Islam made so much inventions 
in the past that we can say that the Islam belongs to the whole World.

2016-08-14T18:25:24.000Z  Stefan Haken --> Tzimmi The Greek Jr. : U look like one of the fuckers with of the KKK. Greeks were always bitches

Russians very appreciated help from allies. In time of war in Europe, help 
came mostly from US and GB - according to some of sources, up to 3% of all 
necessary supplies came from these states.
