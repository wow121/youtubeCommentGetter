reserve tap and ready to go to go to war for 5 years were Russia of today 
has only about 2 1/2 years or more.Ôªø


2016-06-08T11:18:42.000Z  Uncle Tom --> THEEND123321 : Your post is almost incoherant but you are probably American so I'll lower 
my expectations. If you are saying Russia has low supplies of oil you 
couldn't be further from the truth. Russia is one of the biggest producers, 
if not the biggest producer of oil in the world and also of natural gas 
upon which much of western Europe is dependent. Sources vary but Wikipedia 
puts Russia as second biggest producer after Saudi Arabia with the USA 
third. Think before you write and do an internet search at the very minimum.

2016-06-01T22:59:16.000Z  s : Russia was a great country under socialism with Stalin, but from Kruschev 
to today under capitalism it is very weak and dominated by foreign capital. 
Russia does not even like Russia under capitalism.Ôªø

$3,471,000,000,000. In 2013 and 2014 Russia was on 6th position too ....

'The military Industrial Complex' which is the only existing profitable 
business/industry driving their respective economies. By the way the war in

there is no doubt that the US has the largest capability to put troops 
anywhere in the world. I do not doubt that if the US and Russia were 
connected by land that Russia would come out on top, but the ocean is a 
large place, and that is where the war would truly be fought.
