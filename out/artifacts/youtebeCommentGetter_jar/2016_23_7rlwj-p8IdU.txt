2016-06-01T23:23:59.000Z  THEEND123321 : so behind is this nation that it could maintain a war with its low oil 
and no oil  reserve that will put it past 5 years which the USA has a oil 
reserve tap and ready to go to go to war for 5 years were Russia of today 
has only about 2 1/2 years or more.﻿


2016-06-08T11:18:42.000Z  Uncle Tom --> THEEND123321 : Your post is almost incoherant but you are probably American so I'll lower 
my expectations. If you are saying Russia has low supplies of oil you 
couldn't be further from the truth. Russia is one of the biggest producers, 
if not the biggest producer of oil in the world and also of natural gas 
upon which much of western Europe is dependent. Sources vary but Wikipedia 
puts Russia as second biggest producer after Saudi Arabia with the USA 
third. Think before you write and do an internet search at the very minimum.

2016-06-01T22:59:16.000Z  s : Russia was a great country under socialism with Stalin, but from Kruschev 
to today under capitalism it is very weak and dominated by foreign capital. 
Russia does not even like Russia under capitalism.﻿

2016-06-05T02:47:38.000Z  Eric Er --> postmortemarg : +postmortemarg how I see you are uneducated:) 2016 hasn't finished yet. I 
don't want to GUESS.... I like the facts. Fact : According to CIA A 
nation's GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) Russia on 6th position with 
$3,471,000,000,000. In 2013 and 2014 Russia was on 6th position too .... 
Conclusion: Russian economy is stable

2016-06-05T02:05:56.000Z  postmortemarg --> postmortemarg : +Eric Er 
GDP growth‎: ‎-1.2% (Q1 2016 Est.) GDP per capita‎: ‎$8,058 (2016) 
(‎nominal‎)
Go live there if you like Russia so much, you probably wouldnt make it lol

2016-06-05T02:04:17.000Z  Eric Er --> postmortemarg : Russia is 6th economy in the World. Who told you that Putin cant even keep 
the Russian economy stable? I should remember you about USA debt of 18trl.

Libya who don't have nuclear arsenal, and who don't manufacture the own 
weapons.
Russia and its BRICS partners along with Iran are the graveyard of 
NATO/AmeriKKKa.
By the way, Russia and the western African States/Nations are developing 
military cooperation. Russia is building a huge naval base in Malabo, 
Equatorial Guinea to encounter the aggression of NATO/AFRICOM/AmeriKKKa in 
the Gulf of Guinea/ Atlantic Ocean. 
Russia/Eurasia/United Sates of AFRICA is the New World Order. FUCK the

никакого значения.. Власть Европы - это не народ, а те силы, которые стоят 
во главе Европейского Союза и НАТО - это Соединенные Штаты Америки, у них 
свои интересы в мире... Давно пора бы уже понять умным людям что никакой 
демократии не существует... Миром движет борьба цивилизаций за власть и 
ресурсы..

on the navy 

2016-06-02T10:32:33.000Z  Surud Patel --> Surud Patel : Does the US or NATO or its Middle Eastern allies really want to end the 
wars. Why would these BRAIN DEAD COUNTRIES want to kill their cash cow. 
'The military Industrial Complex' which is the only existing profitable 
business/industry driving their respective economies. By the way the war in 
Syria is still alive & well & will be so till the people rise up against 
their Governments & say STOP IT 'Enough is Enough'.

2016-06-02T06:30:24.000Z  arat360 --> Surud Patel : The thing is that while Russia certainly has a stronger standing military, 
there is no doubt that the US has the largest capability to put troops 
anywhere in the world. I do not doubt that if the US and Russia were 
connected by land that Russia would come out on top, but the ocean is a 
large place, and that is where the war would truly be fought.

2016-06-02T06:27:20.000Z  Executive 1 --> Surud Patel : it took europeans and u.s years to end the war in syria but it took russia 
6 months to get some type of cease fire going
