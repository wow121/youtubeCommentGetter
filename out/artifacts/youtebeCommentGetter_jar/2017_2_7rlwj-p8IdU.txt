2017-01-08T12:56:40.000Z  Dalton Morgan : I am very unimpressed with the Pak-Fa.

The F-22 has 'Super Cruise' and a top speed of over Mach 2. An internal bay 
that I just can't see the internal bay on the Pak-Fa; perhaps those are 
side bays?

As for stealth, $50 million ... you get what you pay for. If you tell me 
you have a Mercedes (2017) with all the bells and whistles and it only 
costs $30k compared to $100k , you are not getting a [TRUE] Mercedes for 
$30K ... don't fool yourselves!

Avionics, stealth coatings, software, hardware ... it all costs money!

The front and mid sections of the Pak-Fa are similar to the F-22 ... OK, I 
will believe that similar engineering goals yields similar outcomes in 
shapes and proportions and not just copying because it saved time and money 
... but the rear of the T-50 [IS NOT] stealth!

Any RADAR on the six of the Pak-Fa would pick up those nice round very hot 
metallic exhaust tubes!

The T-50 would have to rely on 20th Century chafe and their goes the whole 
premise of a 21st Century Gen 5 stealth fighter.

Too say nothing of the fact the engine russia claimed would power Pak-Fa to 
fifth generation specifications (Izdeliye 30) is nowhere near being built, 
let alone the years of proper testing that would be required for Pak-Fa to 
be truly considered combat ready. The company tasked with building the 
engine said it wont be completed until around 2025 at the earliest 

Pak-Fa is an illusion....not a real plane﻿
