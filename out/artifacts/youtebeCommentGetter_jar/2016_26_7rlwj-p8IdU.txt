2016-06-24T01:22:05.000Z  Dr. Ronald Cutburth : Great compilation of Russian defense power.﻿


2016-11-08T07:29:19.000Z  Arafang Ndow --> Dr. Ronald Cutburth : Am from Africa ,i just become a US citizen, i love America and i always 
pray for not Clinton to win this election. 
Because she will bring a war between usa and Russia which is going to be 
the worst one could witness. 
She think America is can win a war with Russia make no mostake .

2016-09-13T13:00:36.000Z  Gerald Kocijowsky --> Dr. Ronald Cutburth : are a member of the illuminati?

2016-07-23T04:05:46.000Z  Dr. Ronald Cutburth --> Dr. Ronald Cutburth : George Bush Sr. gave us his plan for perpetual war in his speech "We have 
the opportunity of creating a New World Order-And we will win". That plan 
to win makes everybody who opposes the New World Order the adversary that 
will lose. We have seen a world at war since then followed by President 
Bill Clinton then George Bush Jr. The historical name of the "Defense 
Department" has become in fact the war dept. Dr. Ronald Cutburth, 
Engineering Scientist, Intelligence Expert.

2016-07-23T03:38:13.000Z  Dr. Ronald Cutburth --> Dr. Ronald Cutburth : George Bush jr gave us the words for attack in his public statements on a 
misile system of "First Strike Capability". Go find those statements. After 
he destroyed the World Trade Center buildings with explosives he started 
his "War on Terror" which include an attack on Afganistan, other countries 
and on the US citizens. The US new aircraft F22 and F35 are usually called 
attack aircraft. That language is now part of NATO language. Also the real 
plan by the US/NATO are aggressive hegimony and attack movements showing 
they will attack Russia. Dr. Ronald Cutburth, engineering scientist, 
intelligence expert.

you like what you see maybe we can collab sometime.﻿


2016-06-22T15:54:19.000Z  Gort Newton : Russia looks ready. The USA is pressuring Russia (sanctions etc.) and that 
is a prelude to war. It is exactly what the USA did to Japan prior to Japan 
attacking the USA. Everyone is ready, all that is needed now is a start 
date to WW3 and that will be after Hilary becomes president (she is assured 
of becoming president as that is what the Neocons have pre-determined.﻿

2016-06-20T10:15:03.000Z  Hatem Omar : US:
you guys are so bananas when it comes to show of power... you LOOK good, 
SOUND good, ACT good. You have a BACKBONE of smart aces designers and 
engineers. HOWEVER, you misallocate by NATURE... you miss by NATURE... if 
the strike hits - and that's one huge IF - it would be DEVASTATING !!!!
Because all you care about is the show... Your movies speak louder than 
anything, that you're trying to prove to your own selves - before proving 
to the whole world - that you're invincible... But as you have that 
arrogance, you'll be ashing !!!!

RUSSIA:
you guys are the unknown soldiers... Less talk, More work. The huge 
dedication you put in each and everything you build, have built or will 
build put you on the second ranking with SERIOUS WORK. Possibility for 
mistakes N/A, because each and every soldier, sergeant, commander knows 
what has to be done, how it's done and when is it done !!!!!
EFFICIENT - rather than look, sound act good - and HEADING TO PERFECTION... 
Isn't about neither firepower, nor accuracy, but BOTH !!!!!﻿
