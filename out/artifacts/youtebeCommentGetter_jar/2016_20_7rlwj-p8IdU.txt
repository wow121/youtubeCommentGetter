1. Fucking russians? Russians good people.
2. Why you needed to be protected from Russians? I remind that it is Hitler 
(Western civilization) and almost all Europe attacked Russians in 1941, and 
in 1945 you (Western civilization) launched Cold war against Russians and 
this war against Russians continues still in spite of the fact that 
Russians liquidated the Warsaw pact, left Afghanistan, Eastern Europe, 
Vietnam, Cuba, liquidated the USSR, refused a communism. But you still 
didn't refuse Cold war against Russia. The USA promised Gorbachev that 
Eastern Europe won't become part of NATO, you deceived and it is an act of 
aggression against Russia. Moreover, even the former republics of the USSR, 
the Baltic countries, became part of NATO, it is an act of aggression 
against Russia. Today you place military bases there, it is an act of 
aggression against Russia. The USA organizes idiotic propaganda in Sweden 
about the Russian submarines to force this country to enter NATO, you try 
to make with Finland the same shit and it is an act of aggression against 
Russia. The USA organized revolutions in Georgia and in Ukraine, the 
American puppets provoke Russia and it is an act of aggression again. 
AGGRESSION of the West against Russians. So who is fucking and from whom it 
is necessary to be protected?

+Gog Mclaine: "defended democracy against communism"
You protected not democracy, you protected capitalism, probably it is 
pleasant to you when 1% of people super rich, and remaining 99% on the 
verge of poverty. Propaganda of capitalists still works well, such fools as 
you have the outstanding credits in 10 banks and try to take the credit in 
the eleventh, BUT HATE COMMUNISM. And real democracy, a possibility of 
simple people to influence in the USSR was much more than in such 
totalitarian country as the USA where banksters can kill the president and 
members of his family because of the fact that they didn't want to submit 
to those people about whom you know nothing. These people rule America, but 
not your presidents. John Kennedy didn't even try to be completely 
independent, but it was killed. This your false democracy, Judeo-Masons 
kill your presidents as dogs, and you tell fairy tales about democracy. LOL!

Christians will join and follow the Mormons the Lord has setup places of 
refuge and safety where no weapon will harm them.  Time it getting shorty 
and we are commanded to prepare with water and food for one or two years 
for each person in the family, ,   Obama is up to no good and Hillary is 
also She is a raging demon who want power and fam but she will go down,  
Trump is very sincere and honest he cares about America but will he make it 
great again?  I say no,   but he will slow the beast down but their fight 
to take the United States and turn it into a communist nation with one 
world gov't  will not stop them,  we are in a awful situation and millions 
of Americans are unaware of it many careless about the future of this 
nation,  God is going to bring this nation down and destroy the wicked by 
using the wicked enemies the Chinese and the Russians are will prepared for 
war,  we are being attack by those globalist who want out presidents to 
disarm the people and leave them helpless when only criminals will have 
them,  but there is millions of good Americans that will stand and fight 
against this evil gov't and also against the Chinese and the Russians they 
will cover much of the nation but they will not win in the end the Lord God 
has his plans for this nation for this Land we call America....
