2016-05-15T19:04:12.000Z  Tagashka --> hugoraphaeli : +Gog Mclaine: "saved us from the fucking russians"
1. Fucking russians? Russians good people.
2. Why you needed to be protected from Russians? I remind that it is Hitler 
(Western civilization) and almost all Europe attacked Russians in 1941, and 
in 1945 you (Western civilization) launched Cold war against Russians and 
this war against Russians continues still in spite of the fact that 
Russians liquidated the Warsaw pact, left Afghanistan, Eastern Europe, 
Vietnam, Cuba, liquidated the USSR, refused a communism. But you still 
didn't refuse Cold war against Russia. The USA promised Gorbachev that 
Eastern Europe won't become part of NATO, you deceived and it is an act of 
aggression against Russia. Moreover, even the former republics of the USSR, 
the Baltic countries, became part of NATO, it is an act of aggression 
against Russia. Today you place military bases there, it is an act of 
aggression against Russia. The USA organizes idiotic propaganda in Sweden 
about the Russian submarines to force this country to enter NATO, you try 
to make with Finland the same shit and it is an act of aggression against 
Russia. The USA organized revolutions in Georgia and in Ukraine, the 
American puppets provoke Russia and it is an act of aggression again. 
AGGRESSION of the West against Russians. So who is fucking and from whom it 
is necessary to be protected?

+Gog Mclaine: "defended democracy against communism"
You protected not democracy, you protected capitalism, probably it is 
pleasant to you when 1% of people super rich, and remaining 99% on the 
verge of poverty. Propaganda of capitalists still works well, such fools as 
you have the outstanding credits in 10 banks and try to take the credit in 
the eleventh, BUT HATE COMMUNISM. And real democracy, a possibility of 
simple people to influence in the USSR was much more than in such 
totalitarian country as the USA where banksters can kill the president and 
members of his family because of the fact that they didn't want to submit 
to those people about whom you know nothing. These people rule America, but 
not your presidents. John Kennedy didn't even try to be completely 
independent, but it was killed. This your false democracy, Judeo-Masons 
kill your presidents as dogs, and you tell fairy tales about democracy. LOL!

2016-05-12T11:16:50.000Z  Ovak Wood --> hugoraphaeli : +Gog Mclaine Что такое демократия? Спросим у жителей Югославии, Ирака, 
Ливии, Афганистана, Панамы, Ирана и многих других. Они ответят: "Когда мы 
слышим слово демократия, то смотрим в небо, с какой стороны на нас упадут 
американские бомбы?"

our nation in the US stranglehold.﻿

follow by the Chinese from the west,  many major cities will be nothing but 
smoke leaving millions dead and many suffering the United military will be 
helpless in stopping mass  invasion of Chinese, North Koreans and Russians 
troops 1000's of Chinese ships with Tanks and soldiers in the 1000's that 
will land at the US shipping yards LA will suffer many nuke attack's and 
millions of wicked Americans perish ....﻿

Gov't will fail and will fall and the people will be raging and killing 
just for a apple or a class of water, cities against cities and States 
against each other the only places that will be some what safe will the 
Rocky mountains where the Saints will gather the Mormons and many 
Christians will join and follow the Mormons the Lord has setup places of 
refuge and safety where no weapon will harm them.  Time it getting shorty 
and we are commanded to prepare with water and food for one or two years 
for each person in the family, ,   Obama is up to no good and Hillary is 
also She is a raging demon who want power and fam but she will go down,  
Trump is very sincere and honest he cares about America but will he make it 
great again?  I say no,   but he will slow the beast down but their fight 
to take the United States and turn it into a communist nation with one 
world gov't  will not stop them,  we are in a awful situation and millions 
of Americans are unaware of it many careless about the future of this 
nation,  God is going to bring this nation down and destroy the wicked by 
using the wicked enemies the Chinese and the Russians are will prepared for 
war,  we are being attack by those globalist who want out presidents to 
disarm the people and leave them helpless when only criminals will have 
them,  but there is millions of good Americans that will stand and fight 
against this evil gov't and also against the Chinese and the Russians they 
will cover much of the nation but they will not win in the end the Lord God 
has his plans for this nation for this Land we call America....

2016-05-11T11:42:55.000Z  peter schiller : Russia is the greatest nation on the planet. The whole world does respect 
Russia because of their smartness, their great economy and fantastic future 
prospects.﻿


2016-05-11T00:46:35.000Z  Free Independent : The strength of nations, as of individuals, is not found in the 
opportunities or facilities that appear to make them invincible; it is not 
found in their boasted greatness. It is measured by the fidelity with which 
they fulfill God's purpose.﻿


2016-05-10T19:39:11.000Z  hugoraphaeli : Remember after the SWWar the USA used Nazi war criminals to build the CIA 
and its intelligence network.﻿


2016-05-12T11:16:50.000Z  Ovak Wood --> hugoraphaeli : +Gog Mclaine Что такое демократия? Спросим у жителей Югославии, Ирака, 
Ливии, Афганистана, Панамы, Ирана и многих других. Они ответят: "Когда мы 
слышим слово демократия, то смотрим в небо, с какой стороны на нас упадут 
американские бомбы?"

2016-05-10T19:37:46.000Z  hugoraphaeli : France and Russia are natural allies - Hollande is a cretin for embedding 
our nation in the US stranglehold.﻿


2016-05-10T18:27:28.000Z  Mormon The Prophet : The world has less then 8 years before WW3 starts,,  The Russians will 
strike the US like a thief in the night with Nuclear bombs and rockets 
follow by the Chinese from the west,  many major cities will be nothing but 
smoke leaving millions dead and many suffering the United military will be 
helpless in stopping mass  invasion of Chinese, North Koreans and Russians 
troops 1000's of Chinese ships with Tanks and soldiers in the 1000's that 
will land at the US shipping yards LA will suffer many nuke attack's and 
millions of wicked Americans perish ....﻿


2016-05-12T03:46:48.000Z  Mormon The Prophet --> Mormon The Prophet : The their plan the secret combination ,  but the Lord going to allow the 
wicked nations come US Gov't will fall and their New World Order one world 
Gov't will fail and will fall and the people will be raging and killing 
just for a apple or a class of water, cities against cities and States 
against each other the only places that will be some what safe will the 
Rocky mountains where the Saints will gather the Mormons and many 
Christians will join and follow the Mormons the Lord has setup places of 
refuge and safety where no weapon will harm them.  Time it getting shorty 
and we are commanded to prepare with water and food for one or two years 
for each person in the family, ,   Obama is up to no good and Hillary is 
also She is a raging demon who want power and fam but she will go down,  
Trump is very sincere and honest he cares about America but will he make it 
great again?  I say no,   but he will slow the beast down but their fight 
to take the United States and turn it into a communist nation with one 
world gov't  will not stop them,  we are in a awful situation and millions 
of Americans are unaware of it many careless about the future of this 
nation,  God is going to bring this nation down and destroy the wicked by 
using the wicked enemies the Chinese and the Russians are will prepared for 
war,  we are being attack by those globalist who want out presidents to 
disarm the people and leave them helpless when only criminals will have 
them,  but there is millions of good Americans that will stand and fight 
against this evil gov't and also against the Chinese and the Russians they 
will cover much of the nation but they will not win in the end the Lord God 
has his plans for this nation for this Land we call America....

2016-05-11T08:07:28.000Z  Carl --> Mormon The Prophet : +Mormon The Prophet Why would they attack the US?

2016-05-13T17:35:48.000Z  Серёга Друг --> Vapaastihengittävä Cadillac : +Vapaastihengittävä Cadillac Вы сами выбрали такую жизнь :-)

2016-05-08T18:35:31.000Z  WIKTOR Brzęczyszczykiewicz : No i co wy na to Kurwy z USA.

2016-05-08T17:59:34.000Z  VPour Vendetta : Merci, un grand merci pour les images fort bien belles du reste, qui nous 
font chaud au coeur, puisqu'il s'agit d'armes construites par des humains 
et d'humains en guerre contre la pire race de l'Univers infiltrée sur 
Nova126 pour esclavager la race humaine. Merci pour tous ceux qui ont mis 
au point cet armement en vu de la destruction de la sale race intruse sur 
notre planète.﻿


2016-05-08T17:58:06.000Z  Дмитрий Розаков : Turning to the USA , sit straight on the ass !!!﻿


2016-05-08T16:40:11.000Z  Łukasz Kaźmierczak : go russia :) im weating in poland , stop kaczynski﻿

Turkish F-16s.

2016-05-08T15:10:38.000Z  Archer --> Archer : Really? Then why aren't you fucking bozos running the world instead of 
sucking Russia's ass?

2016-05-08T13:49:28.000Z  Charles Flaherty --> Archer : +bill k Russian GDP 2T
US GDP 17T
The US economy is 8x bigger than Russia's.

2016-05-07T22:47:22.000Z  Nordic Ger --> Nordic Ger : rockettech are very good and planetech also.

2016-05-07T20:11:59.000Z  Pentu Prager : We need to bring sanctions against the USA. Russia is been the adult in 
world geopolitics. USA is the the screaming, spoilt, snotty nosed kid in 
geopolitics. Listening to Putin talk, he is thoughtful and uses intelligent 
points. Obama talks bringing fear and emotions. USA and its allies always 
speaks with forked tongue. Saying one thing while doing another is the USA 
and it's allies way. Now Russia has to increase mlitary spending because of 
the threat to its national security from NATO. I am Irish, we are all human 
beings.﻿


2016-05-07T19:18:15.000Z  Юрий Вяткин : разбудили бляди мишку ........﻿

2016-05-07T17:36:22.000Z  Bob White : It's amazing that a country with a GDP below Italy even has an armed force 
at all.﻿


2016-05-08T01:26:39.000Z  gfbutters1 --> Bob White : +Bob White Perhaps because their scientists are proud to work for their 
country and don't hold public finances to ransom over wages, that the 
country has huge natural resource supplies so the raw materials are free, 
and this all means the country can produce much more equipment for the 
fraction of the budget.

2016-05-13T17:53:55.000Z  Серёга Друг --> Authocthonous Illyrian : +Authocthonous Illyrian :-) Нострадамус ! :-D

2016-05-13T16:36:22.000Z  Adam --> Logan Uva : Definitely a great deterrent!

2016-05-13T17:58:02.000Z  Серёга Друг --> Rale Milutinovic : +Rale Milutinovic Привет серб ! Косово - Сербия ! Всё будет хорошо , брат !

2016-05-08T02:31:43.000Z  AKM5.45 SHOOTER --> Gary K : There is no Russian threat. Only NATO/US threat. Russia is not the 
aggressor. Do your homework. NATO is the aggressor

2016-05-12T18:17:20.000Z  communistjesus --> Kiss Nagy : +Kiss Nagy <<< BIGOTRY.....Does not have to be smart, nor know how to write 
in English properly.. BIGOTRY going strong since 1776..

2016-05-09T20:22:02.000Z  Gregor Novak --> Maurizio Omissoni : +XxProxX China works with USA? LOL! China makes an artificial island in 
South China sea, USA puts there an entire fleet. China bans Dollar or any 
Yuan-Dollar exchange, which will weaken Dollar significantly. China has US 
bonds for more than a Trillion of $ and they (China) are threatening you 
with the sale of it or they'll demand it directly from you. Friends don't 
do that to each other. Meanwhile China, Russia & India deepen their 
relationship in army and other industry. You're alone, together with 
Zionist Israel. NO ONE likes US govt! Here in EU 3/4 of all people prefer 
Putin over US Establishment (Elite, Illuminati,...cal them how you like - 
ultra rich, like Rothchild, Rockefeller, Morgan, DuPont families) and if in 
some crazy scenario NATO (we all hate it) attacks Russia, we, people will 
attack NATO on the streets! That's not just my opinion, THAT IS A FACT! NO 
ONE LIKES US GOVT!

2016-05-13T16:35:18.000Z  Adam --> Александр Смирнов : I do not agree with it. I am from US. Most Americans do not support this 
NATO.

2016-05-07T22:52:23.000Z  Nordic Ger --> Arto Adanalyan : für die zählt nur eins. nicht türkische leute umzubringen und dabei geld zu 
verdienen. das geht wenn man die bank kontrolliert und zwei nicht 
türkennationen gegeneinader hetzt.

2016-05-07T22:51:52.000Z  Nordic Ger --> Arto Adanalyan : der amerikaner wird angelogen. genau wie du, und ich.

2016-05-07T22:51:27.000Z  Nordic Ger --> Arto Adanalyan : du brauchst nur wenige leute in den usa zu entfernen und der spuk hört auf. 
Es sind die khazarn die das bankensystem kontrollieren. weiße türken. keine 
juden.

2016-05-08T21:02:57.000Z  Mr. Neverpoint --> DanieL's : +macho55able Yes bro!

approximately 16 percent of the population.

2016-05-13T18:28:44.000Z  Серёга Друг --> Paul Harris : +Paul Harris Да фантастика . Политики думают иначе :-)

2016-05-10T03:12:14.000Z  Konstantin Klimenko --> petereuropa : +petereuropa
we once had a pact with Hitler. More to the word, you guys had one too. So 
what? Did it stop him? Nowhere near it. He was stopped by our tank armies 
and your carpet bombings.

2016-05-09T11:45:05.000Z  petereuropa --> petereuropa : +Kenny911able I hope that NATO and Russia will have a pact together. The 
European history have many such agreement with Russia. It is how to  say a 
normal way to think. We must defend our mostly Christianity history. 
If not, Europe, West Europe will be lost to Islam. That is what it's all 
about. and that is the most important thing in the European history! United 
we must be!The most important thing is: how can we kick out the so stupid 
EU politicians in Bruxelles? How? Please advice. Soon it is too late.

2016-05-07T22:58:17.000Z  Nordic Ger --> Sirait Batak : or your ass is doomed.

2016-05-07T22:58:09.000Z  Nordic Ger --> Sirait Batak : is the New World Order. But its doomed.

2016-05-07T23:01:10.000Z  Nordic Ger --> muhammad daniel izany : but not with thinks you think and not with thinks russia think and not with 
thinks USA think. USA and Russia working together over 100 years. rest is 
SHOW so dont instrumentalize your own ass and mind for the sake of 
khazarian banking mafia and the turkish muslism

2016-05-08T17:54:19.000Z  Calvin Do --> Calvin Do : +Alex Mercer hand to hand combat is vietnam is way more difficult than 
afghanistan. Jungle warfare vs desert.

2016-05-08T02:33:36.000Z  AKM5.45 SHOOTER --> Calvin Do : +Alli Hunsinger Vietnam fought 8 coalition members during Vietnam. The US 
did not cause all of Vietnam's casualty. The ratios is actually the other 
way around. Vietnam slaughtered America's coalition. The causalities for 
Vietnam included civilians as well

2016-05-08T21:13:29.000Z  Dani Rumold --> Janmark Pralkin : +Janmark Pralkin The question is how many are in working order, how many 
does russia have the money to actually deploy and maybee the biggest 
question...when will the crew starve to death heard Food Shortage is an 
issue nowerdays in Russia.

2016-05-14T04:21:41.000Z  siberian alex --> Chandler White : +Chandler White The Idiot is you. Dont lie that you believe in some 
minister 's words. For Russian submarine you will loose at least the nimitz 
class aircraft carrier.

2016-05-08T01:38:00.000Z  Planb 20 --> Jim Bklyn : That's why I think Trump needs to take office, he will actually put 
generals that know what they are doing to work

2016-05-10T02:24:44.000Z  Indonesian FPS --> bassoka bos : yoii broo

you think they are "true" treat?
