2016-04-23T07:45:15.000Z  R WARRIOR : Russia is way behind the United States in technology. Russia is no match 
for the United States. One day the United States will CRUSH Russia.﻿


2016-05-15T07:50:17.000Z  Victoria Chok --> R WARRIOR : +R WARRIOR What?????????
May be you are still in LIQUID FORM in some distance place during the early 
1960's. At that time, the United Snakes of Americunts n its allies were 
begging the Russian Scientists n pilots as well as the Chinese scientists n 
pilots to defect with their latest equipment/technologies to their puppet 
countries promising them big reward in GOLD, CASH n other benefits.
After the breakup of USSR, the United Snakes of Americunts go the the 
former Warsaw countries to grab the "latest" USSR equipment/technologies to 
build new weapons. 
After year 2000, what new weapons, beside *F-35* have United Snakes of 
Americunts develop?

The rest is history.

2016-05-03T14:12:11.000Z  Kenny911able --> R WARRIOR : technologies is an empty word.You can repeat it any day,it doesnt change 
the reality.Russians make murica eat its own shit,and they cant do anything 
with that.Russia just annexed Crimea and what did americunts?Bark like 
dogs.Hilarious impotents.

2016-04-28T22:55:31.000Z  Jenna Flower --> R WARRIOR : Russia have a "Dead hand" system - no Russia - automaticly no planet. 
America going to hell with all world. America not have any chances with 
super alien technologies. ☺

2016-04-25T05:08:52.000Z  Robbie The Great AR --> R WARRIOR : we already did

2016-04-23T04:21:34.000Z  kim miller : putnin has a large tank. i heard all you russian soldiers have big guns. 
obama has a tiny gun. obama is a coward, half his country hates him! down 
with obama. republicans support all those fighting isis. assad and the 
kurds are carrying heavy weaponry too. i love real men!﻿


2016-08-14T18:21:51.000Z  Stefan Haken --> kim miller : Which kurds do you mean?

2016-04-22T22:22:58.000Z  J Plumber : What? No caterpillar silent drive propulsion system or is there? God forbid 
Russia & USA lock horns, it won't be good for humanity sake! Covert 
Jesuit/Jews banking alliance are the real hidden enemies of both nations! 
The love of money (greed, power, control) is the ROOT of all evil.﻿


2016-10-30T10:20:30.000Z  Joël LeMay --> J Plumber : +J Plumber i mostly agree with except for the lucifer part since lucifer 
doesnt exist btw god doesnt exist either its just a made up story by some 
globalist humans that wanted to control the world the worst pard is it 
would have work if no other humans had the same idea but with modern 
science and freedom and the internet we are now realizing just how stupid 
religion really is saddly some people are slower ther most and others 
simply dislike change but if due time and with democracy the whole world 
will be rid of this pesky religion desease

2016-10-26T22:52:31.000Z  J Plumber --> J Plumber : -Mad, yes I am aware of Hitler's "struggle" with the Zionist bankers of 
Rothschild & Co. and all their cronies within the UK, France and Russian 
governments. Henry Ford was actually one of Hitler's mot inspirational 
figures as Ford also felt the weight of these globalist bankers and their 
money lending racketeering policies. Of course, not all so called Jews are 
to be blamed, but their is a cabal aligned with Jesuit cohorts, all bent on 
global government, open borders, depopulation, one religious & 
socioeconomic order under their satanic driven agenda. They are are 
Masonic/Illuminati as well. Lucifer is their God and they get their 
"marching orders" directly via his masterful cunning deception and 
lies...... He is the father of lies and the Grand Deceiver. Why should this 
synagogue .. er SINagogue of Satan that worships their devil be any 
different than their Master? 

Roman Catholicism is also in league with this universal NWO antichrist 
system especially with their Jesuit pope, who by the Jesuit Order's own 
oath of extreme induction, is hell bent on making all the world submissive 
to it's control through this lie of ecumenical inclusion of all faiths 
while they support the influx of Islam througout the western hemisphere in 
order to use as the tool for Martial Law and police state authority, all 
with the populations support for their security. Heck, they even use this 
blatantly false environmental issue like the globalist derived Climate 
Change scam and likewise Sustainability Laws, Re-Zoning & eminent domain 
laws etc (see UN Agenda 2030) to force the ignorant flocks of sheepdom into 
acceptance of their globalist deception schemes. 

RFID implantation is their ultimate endgoal for our near future, plain and 
simple. And if we as awakened and alerted patriot citizens and "freedom 
loving people" don't rise up & resist with every available means and do our 
best to awaken the herd of the masses who are still asleep, devoid of 
critical thinking and reasoning today, then it'll be too late soon. Global 
surveillance is becoming more and more ubiquitous and smart, creeping up 
inch by inch until we find ourselves totally enslaved in it's "NET".

2016-05-04T20:45:49.000Z  Joël LeMay --> J Plumber : +mad hatter no its true because Russia really was an Oligarchy before 2004 
and the US were not even complaining because they were getting a ton of 
profits out of it but as soon as Putin kicked them out of Russia the US 
started yelling at them and giving Russia tons of sanctions yet its 
precisely in 2004 that Russia started to recover because before 2004 or 
more precisely from 1991 to 2003 Russia was in a steady decline and was 
losing over a million population due to starvation every year but now they 
are no longer starving in fact they even started to thrive also now Russia 
is being led by 1 guy instead of a small group of guys and that 1 guy is 
not on America's side he is on Russia's side 

btw you really should take a break from youtube because you really look mad

2016-05-04T20:41:09.000Z  mad hatter --> J Plumber : +J Plumber Glad you are awake my friend. Seems you have unlocked the last 
door, and are truly aware of the real threat to humanity. How awake are you 
regarding Hitler? Hopefully you know that he was fighting for the common 
good, and never gassed any Jews. The bolsheviks were mostly lead by Jews as 
well. Communism is a Jewish foundation. The Federal Reserve is ran by Jews. 
Hollywood, Jews. Everything important is controlled by Jews.

2016-05-04T20:38:42.000Z  mad hatter --> J Plumber : +Joël LeMay Wrong.

don't want Britain to exit the EU.

2016-12-18T04:09:07.000Z  jabber wolf --> Gareth Wilkin : Um Brexit dos exactly that.. it puts power in governments hands instead of 
individuals. They limit your choice. And sorry if you think choice is 
"western". I guess you like eastern retardation and mind control.. that you 
"need" the government to suck your tiny dick for you to make you feel safe.

2016-11-24T14:35:59.000Z  Sergey Sergeev --> Gareth Wilkin : политики стали далеки от людей

2016-10-02T14:06:43.000Z  gfbutters1 --> Gareth Wilkin : Sorry, I love Russia but hate Brexit. I hate anything that inhibits or 
limits peoples own wishes, Brexit does exactly those things and puts power 
into the hands of corporations, mainly western controlled.

history of Russian -Serbian relations. And Russian support for Serbia. I 
should say Serbians are strong people. American regimes in Europe stand on 
suppressing people and historical truth. That is why they will break. 
Remember the history of turkish occupation of Greece. And what is now? 
Truth is always stronger than evil.
