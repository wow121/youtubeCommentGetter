2016-08-06T23:07:38.000Z  matt thomas : ever since the price of oil and natural gas plummeted last year Russia is 
as broke as its been since the early 90's, why do you think they are trying 
to start shit in eastern europe? its to prove to the rest of the world that 
they are still a super-power, putin literally thinks he is the new czar of 
russia.﻿


2016-08-12T18:37:25.000Z  Русское море --> matt thomas : +matt thomas All the shit in Eastern Europe - NATO. NATO deployed in Europe 
the base. American soldiers in Eastern Europe, drink,puke, shit and piss in 
the streets, trashing bars, not pay for the drinks. Where did you see in 
Europe Russia?! Your brain is moldy from anti-Russian propaganda.

2016-08-07T10:37:26.000Z  Александр Желтоухов --> matt thomas : The state debt of Russia to 40,000 times smaller than the United States. 
Russia is a shareholder in US government debt. Are you sure that the 
problem with the Russian economy?

2016-08-07T10:31:49.000Z  Александр Желтоухов --> matt thomas : Federation! A superpower is a myth. US is not a superpower. President 
Putin. Russian do not consider themselves better than others. Russia wants 
to stop the US

2016-08-06T23:08:41.000Z  netdragon256 : Russia needs to tone down its military spending and focus on ECONOMIC 
power, starting NOW. It'll NEVER catch up to the US militarily, nor will 
China. The US pivot to Asia and Brexit is the PERFECT opportunity for 
Russia to make peace with NATO and to develop stronger economic 
partnerships with the EU. The middle East is an opportunity for Russia to 
work as a partner with the US and start some dialogue so it has a 
relationship with US military before a misunderstanding leads to Russia's 
destruction.

Russia is hurting its people by focusing on military. Putin has destroyed 
the Russian economy using false nationalism as an excuse.

Or the alternative is decimation for Russia... The US is about 20 years 
ahead technologically, has 6 times the planes, including F22s that can 
sneak up undetected on Russian planes, change direction mid-air and land 
bullets right on the underside without EVER being seen, even by radar. So 
the Russian pilot is dead before he even knows there's a US plane around. 
The US has more of each class of ships. Along with stealth drones. The US 
military has nuclear round-wing spacecraft that can take off from the 
ground and enter OUTER space (yes, Russia has the intel)! It's a joke. The 
US is primed for outer-space warfare and Russia is still mostly tanks. If 
Russia keeps spending crazy military dollars, the US will just increase its 
spending. The US has to stay ahead of both Russia and China combined 
anyway.﻿


2016-08-12T17:34:58.000Z  cliff njikang --> netdragon256 : With your US National debt at 20 trillion and going up like the space 
shuttle? Who will want to emulate such a disaster just so you can fight 
useless wars and sponsor all known jihadi terrorists?

2016-08-08T22:45:10.000Z  Серега Андронов --> netdragon256 : False

2016-08-06T20:01:19.000Z  78mihovil : )))))JOKE OF THE WEEKEND fuk off Russia Greece and Srbijica ....)))))

2016-08-12T09:16:46.000Z  USA UNITED STATES --> USA UNITED STATES : US army where 1-ci

2016-08-12T13:36:06.000Z  Александр Аношкин --> Juan Matus : +Salavat Julaev они не смогут столько ракет сбить, сколько мы можем 
запустить с земли. у нас техника больше оборонительного потенциала.

2016-08-11T21:54:27.000Z  Salavat Julaev --> Juan Matus : На самом деле российский флот ни о чём и в общем не представляет опасности 
натовскому, как технологически, так и тем более численно. На одну АУГ 
понадобится весь флот, со всех морей и то никаких гарантий успеха нет, да и 
шансов скорее всего. Нужен собственный АУГ, полудохлый Кузя много не 
навоюет, как и железяки типа Москва, сегодня рулят эсминцы типа Арли Берк, 
с их 90ПУ для разных ракет и авиакрыло, с радиусом поражения до 1500км и 
дальше, не считая другие вещи. Ни экономически, ни инфраструктурно, ни 
технически РФ флот способный противостоять НАТО не потянет, в случае войны 
весь флот будет на дне скорее всего.

2016-08-11T21:46:46.000Z  Ali Sherri --> TheMunsters1964 : +TheMunsters1964 rise again without russia.. You do know the evils of 
communism?

2016-08-11T21:45:35.000Z  Ali Sherri --> WaelAWAX عبد الجبار العراقي : Damn your one good stupid troll

2016-08-12T19:03:13.000Z  Русское море --> all4dh8rz : +Alien Moto You forgot to specify that Russia paid America GOLD for "help". 
You modestly about how the United States helped Germany. America is true to 
herself. She has always been enriched by military conflicts.

2016-08-12T17:47:21.000Z  cliff njikang --> all4dh8rz : ' however&#160;they did not win the war alone. Not one bit!' The history 
books have it different. Your fraud will not get you very far. If the 
Russians had not decimated Hitler's Forces when he invaded Russia, All woud 
have been different and you Americans would have had to face the full brunt 
of Hitlers's Army , which was technologically advanced by several 
generations ahead of you! And funny enough, you Americans are walking right 
in his footsteps by invading and destroying smaller defenceless countries 
like Libya, Iraq, Syriua and Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever!

2016-08-11T21:45:16.000Z  Ali Sherri --> Boris Stefanov : I hope you regret it

2016-08-11T20:51:18.000Z  Лысый из Brazzers --> Wiktor Krulik : +Андрей Косиган Так я не понял, ты сосать будешь или нет, либераст?
