are still part of the US arsenal because of their capability . And remember 
, their fighting men (SOLDIERS )come here to train with our MARINES .﻿

Serbia , once the great Yugoslavia , ( to defend the Muslims ) they said

2016-07-23T04:05:46.000Z  Dr. Ronald Cutburth --> Dr. Ronald Cutburth : George Bush Sr. gave us his plan for perpetual war in his speech "We have 
the opportunity of creating a New World Order-And we will win". That plan 
to win makes everybody who opposes the New World Order the adversary that 
will lose. We have seen a world at war since then followed by President 
Bill Clinton then George Bush Jr. The historical name of the "Defense 
Department" has become in fact the war dept. Dr. Ronald Cutburth, 
Engineering Scientist, Intelligence Expert.

2016-07-23T03:38:13.000Z  Dr. Ronald Cutburth --> Dr. Ronald Cutburth : George Bush jr gave us the words for attack in his public statements on a 
misile system of "First Strike Capability". Go find those statements. After 
he destroyed the World Trade Center buildings with explosives he started 
his "War on Terror" which include an attack on Afganistan, other countries 
and on the US citizens. The US new aircraft F22 and F35 are usually called 
attack aircraft. That language is now part of NATO language. Also the real 
plan by the US/NATO are aggressive hegimony and attack movements showing 
they will attack Russia. Dr. Ronald Cutburth, engineering scientist, 
intelligence expert.

germany. CCCP would totaly lose alone

2016-07-18T22:07:42.000Z  Executive 1 --> all4dh8rz : +Alien Moto i agree with you, without that 7% equipment the soviets 
probably would of lost Stalingrad, however most people try to make it look 
like the americans and british fully armed the soviet army 

2016-07-19T21:50:17.000Z  Ricardo Estupinan --> Ricardo Campo : Ruberoid , as you must have notice , i am not criticizing anything about 
Russia ,i know the country and it's people because i was there , ( well i 
only visited Moscow and St Petersburg ) Ii is a beautiful country and the 
people are very friendly . I was only exercising my love for America , i 
have two sons who are American Marines , one , Eddie , was in the first 
Gulf War ( wen Iraq invaded kuwait ) and Brian who served in Kosovo during 
the wronged invasion and devastation of the former Yugoslavia by the US and 
it's allies . Eddie is still with the Marines working at Newburgh military 
air force base in NY. After serving six yrs Brian retired and lives in 
Austin TX.
