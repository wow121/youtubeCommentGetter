2016-12-18T04:17:08.000Z  jabber wolf --> Adolf Hitler : Because Russia does what for you?!?! Sell you 40 year old broken planes?

2016-12-21T08:51:34.000Z  Tony300186 --> Nguyễn Văn Đô : Nguyễn Văn Đô vietnams are good fighters , we won usa

2016-12-18T22:59:57.000Z  Dimigrafius77 --> Dimigrafius77 : In 19-th century- Russia has inavded some countries, i guess (tell me what 
countries pls), like GB, France or USA (even Netherlands and Belgium had 
colonies, cause they all were invaders- was a bad time for weaker nations).
Russia has a lot of energy, Ukraine not. A gas station gas fuel, you not. 
And what now? Gas station don't want you to be energy independent? If you 
have no money for gas or you don't want to buy it- DON'T buy it.
Russia sells their ressources to EU, USA and and and. Russia is producing a 
lot of things, Russia is buying a lot of things. Russia NEVER had colonies, 
all they made is/was "Made in Russia" or earlier "Made in the USSR". Why 
are they parasits?

2016-12-18T22:01:30.000Z  Dimigrafius77 --> Dimigrafius77 : Ok, you have to count:
- 1240-1242 Teutonics attacked Russia cause of Pope- it was a war orthodox 
vs katholics
- 1598-1612 Poland ( was an other name at that time, but the same 
territory) and Sweden attacked Russia, they thought- Russia was weak at 
that time
- 1641-1642 Ottomans declared war on Russia
- 1812 nearly the whole Europe vs Russia
- 1853-1856 Krim war, 4 nations vs Russia
- WW1 Germany declared war on Russia
- WW2 Germany attacked Russia (USSR at that time)

Between this wars the were a lot of invades on russian territories, but the 
agressors lost their armies at the beginning, so you can't count it like 
invades. The invaders were killed to fast. The facts- i told you are facts, 
were a lot of russians lost their lifes.

2016-12-18T04:19:00.000Z  jabber wolf --> Dimigrafius77 : Hmm how many times has Europe invaded Russia , except for Crazy Hitler? 
How many times has Russia invaded and ANNEXED countries into the USSR?
Russia does not want Ukraine to be energy independent. as Russia can only 
make money by being a parasite.

2016-12-18T04:09:07.000Z  jabber wolf --> Gareth Wilkin : Um Brexit dos exactly that.. it puts power in governments hands instead of 
individuals. They limit your choice. And sorry if you think choice is 
"western". I guess you like eastern retardation and mind control.. that you 
"need" the government to suck your tiny dick for you to make you feel safe.
