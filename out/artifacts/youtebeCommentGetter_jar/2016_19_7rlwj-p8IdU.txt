but I believe the best way alternative is not to fight at all.  I for one 
hope the day never comes that we face off against Russia and/or China for 
both nations, like the US possess some awesome weapons capable of 
unleashing unthinkable destruction upon the other.  The best course of 
action is to avoid conflict if possible.  The real danger comes with 
Nations such as Iran or North Korea which very likely would have no problem 
shooting first with no thought of what that would do.  From there it is 
highly possible that an inadvertent conflict between the larger players 
could take place leading to an ever escalating conflict.﻿

2016-08-01T02:01:50.000Z  AKM5.45 SHOOTER --> Wiktor Krulik : +jim mwai You do realize that the world hates American right? It's because 
the US govt made American people look like savages and warmongering 
murderers. I've traveled the world ever since I was 6, and people do view 
Americans as bad people thanks to the US govt. From 6-14, I traveled with 
my parent and met all sorts of people who criticizes American. My mom is 
Vietnamese and my dad is French-American, but people don't realize that we 
all have American citizenship so they talk shit about Americans. Even when 
I got older from 16-present day, I got to travel the world by myself or 
with friends. We all get criticize for being Americans, so I have to speak 
other languages like Vietnamese or French to avoid problems. I've had 
French, Germans, Thai's, Aussies, Latinos (South American nationals), 
Mexicans, and all sorts of people around the world who views Americans as 
being fat, stupid, brainwashed, and lazy. That's the most common thing I've 
heard so far

2016-08-01T01:52:33.000Z  AKM5.45 SHOOTER --> Wiktor Krulik : +jim mwai True. The US government is the problem. Most of the American 
people are good people who are victims of US govt propaganda. Most 
Americans don't even know that Obama legalized propaganda to be used 
against the population a while back. It's called the NDAA amendment 114. 
The media is lying to the American people and the US govt has gone rogue. 
Americans need to stand up to their govt. instead of being two faced when 
the topic is about Russia, Americans need to support Russia. Russia isn't 
the ones going around starting all sorts of war since ww2 ended. Even the 
conflict in Ukraine, Georgia, and Chechenia was lied about by the US media 
and govt. declassified documents proves this

2016-08-01T01:49:33.000Z  AKM5.45 SHOOTER --> Wiktor Krulik : +Jux Lord You're a fucking idiot. The US has invaded 70+ countries and 
started all the wars since WW2 ended, but you're blaming Russia? Fuck you 
piece of shit brainwashed fucked. The US is the aggressor. Americans are so 
stupid and hypocrites. They constantly bash and hate their govt, but when 
the topic is about Russia or China, they act like two faced hypocrites. 
Russia is not the aggressor. The US and their puppet NATO members are. You 
have to be stupid or brainwashed to not know this

Zionist Israel. NO ONE likes US govt! Here in EU 3/4 of all people prefer 
Putin over US Establishment (Elite, Illuminati,...cal them how you like -

2016-05-04T05:48:57.000Z  Gary K : There are some who believe the US could counter any and all Russian threats 
but I believe the best way alternative is not to fight at all.  I for one 
hope the day never comes that we face off against Russia and/or China for 
both nations, like the US possess some awesome weapons capable of 
unleashing unthinkable destruction upon the other.  The best course of 
action is to avoid conflict if possible.  The real danger comes with 
Nations such as Iran or North Korea which very likely would have no problem 
shooting first with no thought of what that would do.  From there it is 
highly possible that an inadvertent conflict between the larger players 
could take place leading to an ever escalating conflict.﻿

industry, it's make a sence. experts have not disappeared, along with the 
country
in a broad sense all weapons was invented in the times of WW2(+cold war) 
and has since upgraded, without war nothing worthy do
be sure, all this talk about super-modern weapons bull shit, ra way to 
steal money from budget

2016-05-01T06:45:20.000Z  AKM5.45 SHOOTER --> Maxx Carter : +Maxx Carter Weak countries?? According to who? The military ranking 
according to America? Vietnam didn't even have a real established military, 
and they defeated and destroyed the US military who fought with 7 other 
coalition members during the Vietnam War. Even the NVA finally got a few 
old Mig jets in, they even won in the air. Why do you think the top gun 
training program was started? Because the US Air Force got beat during 
Vietnam

2016-05-03T14:09:06.000Z  Kenny911able --> Chandler White : +Chandler White youre soi envy.Or butthurt.I love that,i love when american

the reality.Russians make murica eat its own shit,and they cant do anything 
with that.Russia just annexed Crimea and what did americunts?Bark like 
dogs.Hilarious impotents.

2016-05-04T20:45:49.000Z  Joël LeMay --> J Plumber : +mad hatter no its true because Russia really was an Oligarchy before 2004 
and the US were not even complaining because they were getting a ton of 
profits out of it but as soon as Putin kicked them out of Russia the US 
started yelling at them and giving Russia tons of sanctions yet its 
precisely in 2004 that Russia started to recover because before 2004 or 
more precisely from 1991 to 2003 Russia was in a steady decline and was 
losing over a million population due to starvation every year but now they 
are no longer starving in fact they even started to thrive also now Russia 
is being led by 1 guy instead of a small group of guys and that 1 guy is 
not on America's side he is on Russia's side 

btw you really should take a break from youtube because you really look mad

2016-05-04T20:41:09.000Z  mad hatter --> J Plumber : +J Plumber Glad you are awake my friend. Seems you have unlocked the last 
door, and are truly aware of the real threat to humanity. How awake are you 
regarding Hitler? Hopefully you know that he was fighting for the common 
good, and never gassed any Jews. The bolsheviks were mostly lead by Jews as 
well. Communism is a Jewish foundation. The Federal Reserve is ran by Jews. 
Hollywood, Jews. Everything important is controlled by Jews.

2016-05-04T20:38:42.000Z  mad hatter --> J Plumber : +Joël LeMay Wrong.

2016-05-04T20:44:06.000Z  mad hatter --> neo nero : +neo nero You think Putin isn't controlled? Jews run the world, the sooner 
you realize this, the sooner you will understand the true threat.

harm civilians' ? lol, what a gullible boy

2016-05-05T05:00:06.000Z  Ivan Mico --> Ivan Mico : +Gabriel G you must be one of those who did not yet find out that massmedia 
are not here to inform people but to create desired public opinion. Luckily 
Russian airforce has anticipated such lies from western massmedia so they 
were video-recording their sorties and posting them online. So you can 
check them on MOD web site or youtube and prove those lies about thousands 
of civilian causalties from western massmedia wrong. On the other hand US 
does not even try to hide that it bommbs civilians and been doing so since 
1943. Often

2016-05-05T02:20:08.000Z  Blue Cap --> Ivan Mico : +Gabriel G the USA and it's allie's care about Syria because they want that 
pipe line there. And don't give me shit about Russia killing civilians 
because Russia destroys confirmed terrorist targets unlike the USA that 
reasently destroyed a Syrian hospital filled with people and shall I remind 
you that America created Isis and is supporting it right now.

2016-05-05T01:51:23.000Z  Gabriel G --> Ivan Mico : +Fab and Nab  lol. save sirya from the US, why would the US want a piece of 
shit as sirya ? its the Saudi who pulls the resistance wires and supply 
them with guns and ammo.
Also, the Russians dont give a shit about sirya, they want assad to stay, 
thats the only reason they bombarded the area, and BTW they killed 
thausands of civilains by doing so.

2016-05-05T01:36:41.000Z  Blue Cap --> Ivan Mico : +Gabriel G haaa your funny. By now I expect you to know that the USA 
created and supports Isis
